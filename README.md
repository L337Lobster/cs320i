# Individual Project Proposal CS320-101: Software Engineering, Spring Semester 2017 Due Date: 1-29-2017

### Jackson Hofmann

## Summary

I will be designing and programming a website with the purpose of creating and displaying a calendar of events for a student. This will include things like labs, exams, projects, assignments, etc. You will be able to store the due date, grade, and type of calendar entry.

Technologies

- I will be using Grails for the website itself.
- I will be using Groovy as the base language for the servlets, etc.
- I will also be using HTML, CSS, and GSP.
- I will do my work primarily in Intelij and Brackets

## Development Plan

I will first learn the technologies needed for Grails. Next I will design the web interface superficially. Once I have the interface I will proceed to make it more dynamic.
