# Individual Project Proposal CS320-101: Software Engineering, Spring Semester 2017 Due Date: 1-29-2017

### Jackson Hofmann

## Summary

I will be designing and programming a website with the purpose of displaying game data for a game called 7 days to die. I will write a plugin that will allow the website to communicate with the server and gather and store game information. This website will have a page that will allow you to type in a player’s name and get the player’s information, display the explored portion of the map (maybe), and help a player make informed decisions about what to do in game.

Technologies

- I will be using Oxide to create the server plugin, likely using JavaScript or Python.
- I will be using Grails for the website itself.
- I will also be using HTML and CSS.
- I will do my work primarily in Notepad++ (unless the technologies I will be learning require something else)

## Development Plan

I will first learn the technologies needed for Oxide. Then proceed to figure out how to integrate the plugin with the web interface. Next I will design the web interface superficially. Once I have the interface I will proceed to create the server plugin. With the plugin done I will integrate it into the website.
